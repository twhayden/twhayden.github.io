European Union is now facing the reality of having to align itself with a new ally, China. Historically, Western European nations and China have had rather limited relations, with most interactions revolving solely around trade. To supplement other needs, Western European nations (eventually forming the European Union) have relied on other world powers such as the United States. However, with the United States fading from its preeminence and China rising in its place, the EU will have to develop a new relationship with China out of necessity.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.3wqr65v0xgxu"></a><span class="c15">Steve Seifert</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15"></span></p><a id="t.17a0f8d7a1ea29ee988b7c93b926bfb6c9a9f9ca"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c15">PNF stretching VS.

It helps connect people and countries together that may never have had any interactions if it weren&rsquo;t for this technological progress. These new interactions have led to an increase in new global policies including increased trading, especially free trade zones. Globalization has rapidly developed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries and has completely revolutionized the way countries interact with each other. Globalization has allowed access to new and cheaper goods and better relationships between countries, but it comes with its share of people doubting that the benefits of globalization outweigh the negatives that come with it. Donald Trump is someone that thinks the United States should focus more on the U.S. than on the world. He ran on a campaign of bringing back jobs and putting America first instead of focusing on a global approach. Each policy has its own benefits mixed in with negatives, and Trump&rsquo;s proposed policies could have large impacts on American businesses. With the election of Trump, more nationalist policies will be implemented, and only time will tell if they will help or harm American businesses.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.dqk038ya7lfu"></a><span class="c1">Madelaine Kuhn</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.cfd5514f46b55e3a08e3c7ef61eb873e81dac2f4"></a><a id="t.2"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Spazzing Out</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Dystonia is a muscular disease in which the muscles contract uncontrollably.

The goal is to help students make informed decisions by asking questions, seeking answers, and finding and critically evaluating sources of information. We developed a variety of teaching methods, follow-up activities, and assessments to structure the lesson and evaluate student learning. We presented our work at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference in Denver last fall in order to share our ideas and gain feedback from science educators. Last semester, we implemented the case study into two sections of BIO110 lab. We are currently making revisions to the case study based off of observations made during the trial run.

Post-surgical rehabilitation and recovery started off slow, but the athlete has become more focused and is back on track. Non-contact knee injuries are unique in male subjects. Perhaps a previous history of bipartite patella has predisposed this athlete to this particular mechanism of injury.

Starting with an attack on October 21, 2016 that shut down websites based on the East Coast, like the New York Times and Wired, there have been several Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks originating from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Our presentation will define and describe these terms. We will also discuss the code that caused the first major attack, Mirai, and the effects of the code becoming open source. In addition to the code behind the attacks, we will discuss what makes IoT devices susceptible to hacking and how these devices are then used to create a bot army. Furthermore, we will look at what IoT device developers can do to make IoT devices more secure.

By looking at different studies done there are common trends in companies that hold large amount of cash. The size of the company and its availability to external financing plays a large role in the amount of cash a company will hold.

Laws were passed in twenty four states in the United States that supported and encouraged the use of sterilization to control the reproduction rates of the inferior individuals. Although, this is believed to be a circumstance of the past, this is still occurring today in the United States.

Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to manage your own emotions while being able to manage the emotions of others. This type of intelligence is split up into four categories: self-awareness, social awareness, self-management and social skills. It can allow you to say the right things in any person&rsquo;s situation and read their situation and respond to it. This intelligence is used differently with individuals in different majors. Those that are health science majors and going into the healthcare field may need to have a different type of intelligence than those in the either the music or business majors. It could be interesting to compare the type and amount of emotional intelligence those in these majors have. I will use a survey that combines their total emotional intelligence score in combination with seeing what aspect of emotional intelligence they are and if there is a correlation. I believe it could be beneficial for people to know what kind of intelligence they have and what they can work on to better themselves in their field. They can also develop their emotional intelligence and improve on all aspects of their intelligence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.e5vxa37t1214"></a><span class="c1">Erica Meade </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.805dfd17e2e4445952a7e6bbb4940bdc91cb2580"></a><a id="t.22"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">How to get away with Tax Fraud</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Where should one draw the line between legal tax planning and illegal tax fraud?

This research, however, found women to show less regret for non-vaginal hook ups. In the current study, participants completed a survey indicating self efficacy, sexual behavior, and their level of sexual regret. Self-efficacy is analyzed using the General Self-efficacy Scale created by Shwarzer and Jerusalem (1995). This study was designed to assess whether the number of hook ups (defined as a sexual encounter with an individual that one is not dating), is affected by the type of hook up: oral, anal, or vaginal. Furthermore, this study aims to assess whether lower self efficacy leads to lower contraception usage leading to an increase in sexual regret among college students. It is expected that the higher self efficacy will lead to more hookups, less use of contraception, and an increase in sexual regret.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.5pk5hw5eubxm"></a><span class="c1">Matthew Fee</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.2bfba56018185ae2992ed2073af5806e10121ec6"></a><a id="t.25"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The Mystery of Youth Turnout in Presidential Elections</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">This research will examine why youth voting habits have no distinct patterns.

Due to the drop in Wells Fargo, several customers are now faced with distrust and fallback in opening many checking accounting with any bank to this day. Banks are still concerned how to restore the confidence in customers and how they can better contribute to sustainable social and economic growth. Wells Fargo scandal case will then, lead into a discussion on corporate social responsibility (CSR), an attitude putting ethical norms in the spotlight. The CSR pyramid distinguishes various layers of responsibilities and how companies need to comply with legal norms.

It is important to study this relatively new research because as more players take precautions to avoid head injuries the less likely they will experience symptoms. I believe that the impact of head injuries at an early age is a new subject that not many people are aware of and if they were I believe that they would consider different interventions when it comes to the game of football at a young age. A recent study done by Dr. A McKinlay followed confirmed cases of mild head injuries before the age of 101. The group of patients were divided into three different groups. The groups were based on outpatient medical attention, inpatient observation, and the others were non-injured. The results of the study were that the inpatient groups showed an increase in hyperactivity rated by parents and teachers. The conclusion of the study was that most cases of mild head injuries in young children do not produce adverse effects but the long term problems in psychosocial function are possible. A research article published in Brain Injury2 studied the relationship between age of injury and long term neuropsychological impairment. Neuropsychological impairment is an internal and external clinical validation tool that tests cognitive deficits3. In the study, there were 29 children who sustained a traumatic brain injury and were then studied 6 years post injury. The researchers came up with a way to test intellectual knowledge, memory and frontal lobe functions by using paper and mechanical tools. The results were compared to 29 normal control subjects and from these results the researchers concluded that the younger the child was when they sustained a traumatic brain injury the worse the cognitive outcome was. The hypothesis of my research is that if more people are aware about the effects of head injuries at an early age, they will not choose to play football as a child. The research I am doing will add to the research that has already been established by providing the opinions of people from a small community, and establishing the basic knowledge concerning the effect of head injuries.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.ujkm7h7pwoee"></a><span class="c1">Sarah Baudo </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.7af2004360788d5686e60a5aa212e36a30ec982c"></a><a id="t.47"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Build Your Ideal Relationship</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">The experimentation was performed to better understand the characteristics people would choose to build their ideal mate.

Cryotherapy has become a popular treatment to help decrease muscle soreness. However, evidence on cryotherapy has been controversial on if it really prevents and speeds up recovery or if it just satisfies the mind. The object of this study was to see if cryotherapy just helps physiologically or if it is influence by a psychological belief. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Research data was obtained from the athlete&rsquo;s ratings on muscle soreness when using cryotherapy and when they do not use cryotherapy treatment after a workout. The muscle soreness was rated on a Likert scale, one to six, on a sheet of paper. Athlete&rsquo;s perception on cryotherapy was obtain through a survey that took place at the very end of the experiment. The results were analyzed to find if cryotherapy treatment has an impact on muscle soreness or if it has a placebo effect. The hypothesized outcome was that cryotherapy will help prevent muscle soreness with the influence of the athlete&rsquo;s perception on cryotherapy. These findings will help athletes, coaches, and healthcare providers know if cryotherapy is an appropriate treatment for muscle soreness which will help the athletes perform at their best. The hypothesis was rejected and cryotherapy did not completely prevent muscle soreness, but did cause lower muscle soreness ratings. This was not true for all athletes who did believe in cryotherapy and used it. Athletes who never used cryotherapy and do not believe in it did have lower muscle soreness ratings the first week and higher ones the second week. The athlete&rsquo;s perceptions did not have a huge impact on the ratings.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.bia2grme5po0"></a><span class="c1">Jack Onderisin</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.72ae872f23bd16c4db9b8f1887b36f3241770aa2"></a><a id="t.50"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The Chinese Banking and Economic policies and their effect on the US - Chinese Relationship</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">China and the United States are two of the world&rsquo;s largest economies in terms of GDP.

There are two main types of sex education--abstinence only which does not allow for discussion of contraceptive use, and comprehensive education which does allow for such discussion. When comparing youth in abstinence based programs and those not in any program, results showed that both groups had a similar mean age for starting sexual activity, and had the same likelihood of unprotected sex, reported pregnancy rate, and average number of sexual partners (Trenholm et al., 2008). Based off of these findings, the hypothesis for this current study was that respondents who received either an abstinence only education or no sex education would have similar age of first sex, lower rates of contraceptive use, and lower confidence in their knowledge about preventing STDs when compared to students who received a comprehensive form of sexual education. The hypothesis was supported with the exception that students who received comprehensive sex education did not have higher rates of contraceptive use.

My hypothesis is the more a person uses the social media outlet, the more important receiving likes is to them thusly making their self-confidence dependent on their social media use. Posting more often may make a person more susceptible to a stronger dependency on the liking system, which in turn effects their mood and self-confidence. This idea can create a cyclical effect because if a person&rsquo;s self-confidence is dependent on their use on social media, they will continue to keep using social media. Social media is based on a system that people have to validate and judge each other&rsquo;s posts, and this can lead to negative experiences (Kim &amp; Ahmad, 2012). Another study found that emotional stability was a negative factor that social media users share, and this was varied by the gender of the user (Brooks, 2015). Yang &amp; Srinivasan (2016) conducted a study that found that greater use of Facebook specifically led to lower affect of a person and life satisfaction. Continuing research on social media will help expand upon the current affects it has on its users.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.nfjpi23x5qea"></a><span class="c1">Samantha Malloy </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.6310e1830255b27712928cf6f66767756c4c02e1"></a><a id="t.54"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Hand-Eye Coordination Development: Effectiveness on Fine Motor Skills in Former Sufferers of Concussions</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Annually, over one million individuals in the United States suffer a concussion from falls, sports activities and car accidents.

It was not until people began questioning whether or not animals had similar rights to humans, and inquiring if those rights were being violated through the minimal care routines that zoos began improving their facilities. In order to decrease stress, improve human-animal interactions, and increase socialization, research and various experiments were needed to determine what was to be done. Currently, zoos are putting a majority of their efforts into naturalistic enclosures that allow captive animals to behave and interact as they would in the wild, as well as ensuring that there is trust between zookeepers and animals to reduce stress and improve the lives of permanent residents. Those that are not permanent residents are treated with little human interaction for conservation purposes, making it a better transition to release them into the wild once they are able to care for themselves, increasing conservation efforts in and out of zoo facilities. With all of the efforts and new procedures being implemented in zoo and animal facilities, captive animals are receiving more ethical care than ever before.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.ybrytup03mxn"></a><span class="c1">Ryan Brewer</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.a6da701095953f3db2f41dd70728fcfd4a8814dc"></a><a id="t.62"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">How Video Games Affect the Brain</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">This study will test to see if the amount of time spent playing video games has any affect on brain activity.

My hypothesis is that a moderate amount of time spent playing video games will prove beneficial to a student. This will be tested by dispersing a survey through Student Announcements. Individuals GPA&rsquo;s, year in school, sex, and time spent playing video games will be required and all of these statistics will be tied together to determine if playing video games has a positive or negative effect on the brain. Social activities will be inquired about to determine how well the individuals communicate to others and react to others. The hypothesis is that individuals who play a moderate amount of video games, as well as studying, will have a higher GPA due to the benefits of moderate video game play. They also should have higher social skills due to the amount of social activities in today&rsquo;s video games. The communication factor should lead to higher social skills. There are minimal risks for this study and participation is voluntary. Participants must be above the age of 18 and are free to drop out of the study at any point in time.

I am referring to the United States government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC&#39;s concept for investors in the market, whether they are a large institution or an individual, is to have the same basic information available to them to use when they are deciding whether to invest and while they are invested in those securities. The SEC works to ensure that companies are providing relevant and reliable information to the public. They work closely with Congress, government agencies, private organizations, and investors to determine what changes to regulations or additions need to be made for the betterment of the securities market. They are responsible for the oversight of the accounting and auditing field that must comply with the appropriate accounting standards and federal securities laws that are in place. Since the SEC does have significant influence in the securities market, it is interesting to look at the impact that a speech or announcement has on reporting firms and the market that was made by them. I will present my findings on the extent to which the Securities and Exchange Commission can influence the way reporting firms are expected to carry out their jobs with these simplistic methods.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c33"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c33 c28"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.i24hd7179ct0"></a><span class="c1">Cory Jacobs </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.eb0af7c09cb53a2fb8156703d69e836e6212b10d"></a><a id="t.64"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Small Business Legal and Tax Reform Comparisons</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Small businesses establish an important foundation for the United States economy by operating and developing the majority of firms within the country.

A brief survey was sent out through student announcements and data was collected through the online survey. Two main comparisons were focused on: weight gain versus injury, and athletic involvement versus injury. The research showed that weight gain did not affect the likelihood of injury and athletics did affect the likelihood of injury. 66.7% of students who gained 15lbs or more also experienced an injury, but 63.5% of students who did not gain a substantial amount of weight (15lbs or less) still experienced an injury. 72.3% of students who competed in athletics reported an injury as well.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.e5vj37lq9cq4"></a><span class="c1">Courtney Arbogast </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.22c732fc53d71e1d508a6b8250d6580ae5a334ca"></a><a id="t.66"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Examining the Well-Being and Connectedness of Social Groups in College Students</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">This study aims to measure the relationship between social group membership, well-being, and social connectedness.

Social disconnection has a negative effect on well-being, and as social connections increase, so does well-being (Haslam, Cruwys, Haslam, Dingle, &amp; Chang, 2016). It is hypothesized that higher social involvement will have a positive association with well-being and social connectedness. Results from a sample of 151 students from a private liberal arts university in the Rust Belt has shown identification as a student athlete is associated with significantly higher social connectedness, compared to students who identify as part of Greek life, or students who identify and neither Greek nor athlete. Involvement in both Greek life and athletics is not associated with a significant increase in social connectedness beyond the association with athletics. When adding self-esteem as a predictor, the average increase in social connectedness for athlete&rsquo;s decreases. In other words, group identity matters in the formation of social connectedness, but the effect of identity is separate from the influence of self-esteem.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.3n5098eolir3"></a><span class="c1">Shawn Beltz</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.cab1675a37ef96aa4c67b9ffddd038dcd0b69e7e"></a><a id="t.67"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Patient Confidence Level in Physician Assistants to Provide Care</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Physician assistants play an integral role in the health care system and will encompass a larger role in the near future. The study conducted was aimed to measure the level of confidence of patients receiving care from physician assistants (PA) and if students interested in the medical field had an increased confidence level. Even though it is a common mid-level provider in the health care world, many individuals still do not fully understand the scope of practice. A short survey was sent out to the Heidelberg University campus community and were encouraged to participate. Qualitative results showed several trends without statistical significance between individuals that have received care from a PA and confidence level. A trend of increased confidence in individuals that were interested in the medical field for a career and that had received care from a PA before completing the survey was also observed. The survey could have been more effective with increased participation and a larger scope of participants. Information on this topic is vital as mid-level providers are on the rise and will be relied more heavily as time moves forward. Mid-level providers are often mistaken for mere assistants and are able to perform varying levels of medicine when utilized correctly and are allowed to practice to the extent of their training.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.8p1x2jcvw1rp"></a><span class="c1">Michaela Honigman</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.059405505e9c59a5ab85e031b762fb642d22ddef"></a><a id="t.68"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Cognitive Differences Between Males and Females</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">At times, people may not understand the opposite sex because males and females are cognitively different (Hannon, 2014).

Based on one&rsquo;s sex a person&rsquo;s brain is stronger in some areas than in others. This research it is not intended to stereotype people by gender but to understand the reason why males or females think and handle things the way they do. The chemicals in the brain plays a major part in the difference in cognitive abilities (Wilder, 1996). It is widely known that men are better in spatial recognition, while women are stronger in the verbal area (Wilder, 1996). The differences between how genders recall information from their memory has significant difference because the females may view something differently compared to a male (Wallentin, 2009).

Soothing scents tend to help aid students in relaxing in a classroom setting, in return, allowing them to stay focused when being presented with material. Scents that increased arousal and emotion were shown to decrease stress levels and increase concentration levels (Kutlu et al., 2008). For example, when lavender and rosemary are inhaled they have similar personal, cognitive outcomes on participants. Effects of these scents include completing a task more quickly, as well as greater sensitivity to visual stimulation, while impacting cognitive performance and decreasing anxiety (Moss et al., 2003).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.nw9da4ja23ox"></a><span class="c1">Denise Bowes (2)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.14c7c84fe204e710cfe9a85167d227fd0f2e0fc8"></a><a id="t.71"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Analyzing the Effects of Eugenics</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">This paper analyzed the history of eugenics and how it brought the world to where it is today with reproduction and genetics.

During this movement, the value of a person was determined by their health and level of intelligence, which indicated that the interest of the community took precedence over the value of any individual (Kopp, 1936). The eugenics movement led the United States to where they stand today with the practice of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) (Baker, 2005 &amp; Damiano, 2011). This paper examines the evolution of eugenics to the health field today.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.8op5hjfniuin"></a><span class="c1">Dominic Frey</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.7061eadf3ea3c7eccf401a4a3e35b0e061571542"></a><a id="t.72"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Stimulating the Housing Market</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">This project is designed to study the housing market.

The few available taxonomic keys for identification of sphaeriids are outdated, ambiguous, and inoperative when identifying immature individuals that often comprise collections. DNA sequencing may help overcome these limitations. The purpose of this study was to investigate gene sequencing as a reliable method of identification for determining the distribution and abundance of native and exotic sphaeriid clams in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Individual clams were morphologically identified and sequenced for the 16S, 18S, and 28S rRNA genes. We considered the identifications to be: 1) a &ldquo;match&rdquo; if the sample was identified as the same species by both methods, 2) a &ldquo;partial match&rdquo; if there were multiple possibilities for either method, and there was overlap between the two, or 3) a &ldquo;non-match&rdquo; if the results were discordant. Of the 129 samples identified, there were 36 matches, 77 partial matches, and 16 non-matches. Further refinement of gene sequencing technology is needed to provide unambiguous identifications of the sphaeriid species known in the Great Lakes and those suspected of colonization.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.8q1526q5o76u"></a><span class="c1">Emily Howe</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.a8b1f597e5ee8e83e70dd39e6fd5820653d6ace4"></a><a id="t.74"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The Ethics of Placebo in Research</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">The use of placebos in clinical studies has been an issue of ethics for decades.

Technically, if a person is born into a Malay family and a Muslim, he/she is a Bumiputera and thus enjoys special privileges that the others are not entitled to. Due to this distinction, Muslim Malays have better access to higher education due to the racial quota that is set by the Ministry of Education.

Although the presence of subprime loans, specifically mortgages, were well understood and established, little in the form of prevention was done as there was a wide spread belief of a bullish housing market. In general, the consensus designates the primary cause of the U.S. recession due to the credit crisis, which stemmed from the bursting of the housing bubble. This was seen through levels of housing prices departing significantly from their previous fundamental values by the run-up of prices fueled by an increase in demand, speculation, and exuberance, to home price&rsquo;s eventual drop in value. In whole, this could have been alleviated or avoided totally if the market was properly taken into consideration by investors. It becomes clear that this concept of a housing bubble was a major cause, if not the cause, of the housing market crash beginning in 2007. Through examining and deconstructing the U.S. housing bubble, with the use of a multivariate model, an analysis can be derived to show the subsequent creation of a bubble due to irrational exuberance, concluded through data discrepancies in home valuations by means of a regression analysis.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.kcyu8pr5vytf"></a><span class="c1">Brittany Zaleski </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.54adc6f6a32301ba206ec73ee9d94390a01ccbf1"></a><a id="t.77"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Risky Business</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">On college campuses risky behavior is happening all the time.

Our research question is &ldquo;How has Under Armour grown so quickly to become the number two sportswear brand?&rdquo; We are looked at people&rsquo;s views of Under Armour as a brand using a survey. We also did secondary and qualitative research using scholarly articles, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews. We learned from this what makes Under Armour a good business and brand. Our main focus areas were innovation, technology growth, and the overall growth of the brand. We also saw how people heard about Under Armour&rsquo;s brand in the beginning and what made them choose Under Armour&rsquo;s sportswear and footwear relative to competitors. Conclusions that we come up with were based off a survey from Survey Monkey, and off the secondary data and qualitative research done.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.eo5tnygpamam"></a><span class="c1">Kenzie Lundqvist, Rachel Raimondo </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.3599efac34d9b38a06dd7d7ba945810a7175109d"></a><a id="t.93"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Protein or Bust: An Assay of Protein Powder Composition</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Protein powders are prevalent in today&rsquo;s society and are used by many people, often because they hope to reap greater results from their physical activities such as lifting, cardio, or other sports. When protein powders are produced, they may undergo chemical changes to their composition which may alter their components. Proteins or amino acids that may have been initially introduced to the powder may no longer be present in the final product. An assay of various protein powders can help determine the concentration of proteins in these products, and it can then be concluded whether the products&rsquo; labels accurately reflect their content or not. In addition to concentration, the assay can also help to determine the composition of the proteins themselves which further denotes the veracity of the product labels. A cost-analysis of the protein powders is carried out to compare the labeling accuracy versus final content of the various products. As a result of these analyses, the debate concerning if these products should be regulated by national standards is examined, and the effects this would have on the laws, ethics, and business surrounding the subject is also explored.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.bxgn6hg9nm9z"></a><span class="c1">Colin Higgins </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.150e9c952fbf2d50befe3c5d4a9b1af49b612fc4"></a><a id="t.94"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Battling a Culture of Impunity: Probable Solutions for Gender-Based Violence in Post-Conflict African Societies</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Faced with infertility, psychological scarring, being socially ostracized by family and community, and much more, the women who have suffered from gender-based violence during and after conflict deserve protection and support from the international community.

Given the nature of many conflicts and the prevalence of weaponry, many internally displaced persons, especially females, become vulnerable targets for gender-based crime.

While some still stick to traditional face-to-face interaction, others try to find partners through online websites and apps. The problem now lies if one way of dating is better than the other, or if online dating is the same and can replace traditional dating. Online dating is so common that one out of every five relationships is started from online dating (Hamilton, 2016). One of the main problems that occur from online dating is people lying on their profiles, because of the anonymity felt from using the internet (Rosen, Cheever, Cummings, &amp; Felt, 2008). However online dating is not restricted to close geographical proximity unlike traditional dating. Although both types of dating have positives and negatives research supports that relationships that start from both types of dating have about the same satisfaction in their relationships (Hall, 2014). Currently, there is no research that supports that there are more benefits to online dating in comparison to traditional dating.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.whk3p80y8r6"></a><span class="c1">Karlie DiRuzza </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.cd90afc1cf08f6b9a865ff39ac49467564bd551e"></a><a id="t.97"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">How Well Do You Know Your Healthcare Provider?</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">As the shortage of physicians in primary healthcare escalates in today&#39;s society, the need for non-physician primary care providers is increasing. These non-physician providers include physician assistants and nurse practitioners- health professionals that are qualified to deliver much of the same care as general physicians. Many people are unaware of this shift in patient care and are uneducated on the services that each profession is capable of providing. The object of this study was to determine how well students understand the roles of these providers. The results of my research indicated that today&#39;s young adults have a weaker understanding of physician assistants and nurse practitioners as compared to general physicians. These findings implicate the need for increased education regarding non-physician practitioners so their roles within the health care system can continue to grow, and the shortage of primary health care providers can be reduced.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.8o5r0t6jsxyy"></a><span class="c1">Gregory Raimondo </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.924328e7f54c44dddf9dd9729b89389a7604c4be"></a><a id="t.98"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">How Reliable are Urinary Dipsticks in Assessing Hydration Status</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">In a 2003 study conducted by Stuempfle and Drury, three methods were compared in the testing of urine specific gravity in college wrestlers.

I am interested to see how many of the tested dipsticks are considered to have a strong positive correlation (r = 0.8-1.0) when compared to the refractometer.

There has been a shift from physical questioning methods to mental questioning methods throughout the history of the criminal justice process in the United States of America. There are many ethical issues seen in the act of interrogation due to the secretive aspect that has always been associated with it. In the effort to fix ethical errors seen by detectives, there has been a push for recording through body cameras on officers while on duty and videotaping in the interrogation room. Even though videotaping may get rid of some unethical behavior, the line of what is ethical and what is unethical is hard to define. The average citizen would not be able to understand the differences between legal and illegal methods of interrogation if the videos were released for courtroom purposes. These issues are discussed in more depth while proposing different methods of what should be done to make the interrogation room a place for ethically sound methods.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.2lqd30akp198"></a><span class="c1">Anna Freidin </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.073b450cd03cd574c6bc019e88437f136337408c"></a><a id="t.101"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The Difficult Choice: A Short Story</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Many times in life we are all faced with having to make difficult decisions.

While the Argentine politicians hid this injustice well at first, the international community discovered the violations of basic human rights rather quickly. The United Nations, Amnesty International, and other key humans rights groups became involved but encountered obstacles in their attempts to end the violence. The Catholic Church and Vatican ignored the tragedy for the most part, further marginalizing the victims.

Easy signs to detect if a child has the gene is by watching them walk and if it seems like they have a waddling gait then you want to report it.

Venture capitalists have the power and funds to invest in small businesses that need capital to grow.

They all look are particular things in a small business that either attract them to invest in a potential business opportunity or repel them from making a deal to invest in the small business. The decision-making process is a very complex area to look at in a venture capitalist because there is not a particular set amount of criteria that every single venture capitalist looks at. However, in general, all venture capitalists look at both qualitative and quantitative criteria when evaluating a potential business opportunity. In this paper, I argue that a venture capitalist looks more at qualitative or non-numerical criteria rather than quantitative criteria when looking to invest or not in small business opportunities. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.4zgeywgwv0uw"></a><span class="c11 c30">Joshua Beacorn </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16"></span></p><a id="t.79f115fbcd275f09b98616e4e3489ab437b70704"></a><a id="t.109"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c15">Binswanger Disease</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c16">*email sent about abstract</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.lzppe0d0x42x"></a><span class="c13">Jessica Wagner</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><a id="t.88ceb4b82aa37ee8f3b7ace800afa8d7714fa0d9"></a><a id="t.110"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c19">Information about the disease, how it&#39;s treated and theories as to what causes it and possibly ways to prevent it.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.xrtzhe69ec2f"></a><span class="c13">Myles Wright</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><a id="t.0aa5faee5c34c14632770bd1210fbae1fdd161fb"></a><a id="t.111"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Stem Cells - Knowledge and Perception</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c19">In recent years, Healthcare has dominated media on all levels.

The results from this experiment showed that the average score was a 59%. The highest score was a 9/10 and the lowest being 1/10. This result was less than ideal however expected. Hopefully this brief review shed some new light on this enigmatic field and perhaps steered a few students into researching the topic further.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.326y7u7vliys"></a><span class="c13">Jarrod Wehinger, Elliot Nakanishi, Alexis wyss</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><a id="t.5efbad7dcaf38a05013a8a94e3ce429142365a76"></a><a id="t.112"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Radiotelemetry Study on Stonecat Madtom</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c19">Stonecat Madtom (Noturus flavus) is a very unique species. Little research has been completed with the Madtoms. Stonecats are one of the only species of catfish that has venom in the tip of their dorsal and pectoral fins, and displays a unique behavioral trait by sharing refugia with other Madtoms. Generally, Ictiluridids are territorial fish that do not tend to share their homes with others. We used radiotelemetry along with small tracking devices with different frequencies per fish to look at patterns seen with the fish for about a 2 week span. A GPS device was then used to record the locations of each fish. Data was collected both day and night. A GIS program was then used to plot the points and further calculations were made.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.boyra09r54fi"></a><span class="c13">Kortnie Anderson </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c13"></span></p><a id="t.271bfc0b6cc9dff967a8453be2b8ee1b78dcc709"></a><a id="t.113"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c13">It&#39;s not all Black and White: A Study on Racial Predispositions</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c19">When people think about a criminal it is almost an automatic response to think of an African American person. Perceptions about the presumed racial identity of criminals may be so ingrained in public consciousness that race does not even need to be specifically mentioned for a connection to be made between the two because it seems that talking about crime is talking about race (Barlow, 1998). The stereotype of Blacks as criminal is so pervasive throughout society that &ldquo;criminal predator&rdquo; is used as an euphemism for &ldquo;young, Black male&rdquo; (Welch, 2007). This automatic assumption of Blacks as criminals in society occurs because of priming. According to priming research, the activation of a stereotype increases the likelihood that this knowledge will be used in subsequent judgments (Power, 1996). In other words, once exposed to a stereotype, one is more likely to think about and use that stereotype when making future judgments. The current study has used this information to further test this stereotype. It aimed to determine if Blacks are more often associated with negative scenarios than Whites as well as if the Blacks as criminal&rsquo;s stereotype is just a prominent with children as it is with adults.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><a id="id.kfls5hqk8q6c"></a><span class="c13">Kortnie Anderson 2</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8"></span></p><a id="t.acdfec8a2d3bad87db76f359d3f19f081f19026e"></a><a id="t.114"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Ethics Involving Psychologists and Interrogations</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c12">This presentation takes a topic that is highly controversial in the world of psychology and analyzes all sides of the debate to, ultimately, come to the best possible course of action. That issue being the involvement of psychologists in our military and, more specifically, the role they play in interrogations. Issues arise when interrogations turn violent and use methods of torture, as psychologists have a duty to protect people from and prevent harm. The debate is between whether or not the involvement of psychologists in these interrogations is preventing or protecting harm. This presentation dives into the ethics surrounding a not-so ethical topic, war and interrogations, and analyzes the ethics and possibilities to come up with the most ethical course of action for psychologists.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c5"><a id="id.67ovn1o2etgl"></a><span class="c1">Spencer Blevins</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">UCL Rupture and Repair of a 23 Year Old Athletic Trainer</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Background: A 23 year old female athletic trainer sustained an injury to her left thumb while working practice. The patient complained of pain in the MCP joint of her right thumb on the ulnar aspect and instability with movement. The patient was tender to palpate along the UCL on the MCP joint of the thumb. The patient was unable to grip with her right hand, and found movement in general was difficult and painful. Swelling in the thenar eminence and over the 2nd and 3rd metacarpals close to the MCP joint on the dorsal side of the hand was present. Her UCL was grossly unstable in full extension. Differential Diagnosis: The patient attempted to protect herself from athletes falling into her, which caused an excessive valgus force on the MCP joint of her thumb. After the initial evaluation, possible diagnosis may have been a fracture or ligamentous sprain to the 1st MCP joint. Uniqueness: Usually a surgical repair of a UCL is done with a graft from the patient&rsquo;s palmaris longus muscle, but this patient did not have a palmaris longus muscle in either arm. This surgical repair attempted to preserve the UCL and use an internal brace for support.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><a id="id.x7uhlmoha7vy"></a><span class="c1">Madison Myers</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">PCL Tear in a Male Wrestler</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">A 23 year-old male wrestler, with a previous right anterior cruciate ligament injury has left posterior knee pain. He is unable to put full pressure on his left leg and is unable to fully extend his left knee. Physical signs and symptoms that he is experiencing is mild ecchymosis on the posterior side of his left knee. He heard a pop when the injury occurred and he has a positive posterior tibial sag test. Due to the mechanism of injury the differential diagnosis was a possible lateral collateral ligament tear and possible meniscus tear. After receiving his lab results his MRI confirmed that his final diagnosis was a posterior cruciate ligament tear in his left knee. Treatments for this athlete was to rest, ice, compression, elevation and stabilize (RICES). He was put on crutches until he was able to be full weight bearing without any gait abnormalities. Goals were to reduce the swelling and start rehabilitation to improve his range of motion and strength in his quadriceps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><a id="id.ohhttvcxpz4i"></a><span class="c1">Austin Eaton</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">2008 Financial Crisis: Roles of the IMF, World Banking &amp; Central Banks</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In 2008 the financial crisis backed by the over evaluation of U.S. subprime mortgage bonds sent the world economy into a downspin.

There are many disparities in the healthcare of people with mental illnesses due to the stigma that follows them, and this stigma is just as prevalent in the healthcare sector. This is problem because many people with mental illness have comorbid illness that are being undiagnosed and undertreating, shortening the lives of those with mental illnesses. It is also a problem because many people who have been diagnosed with mental illnesses also face other barriers accessing healthcare such as socioeconomic status and impaired cognitive function. Along with this, there are other populations of mentally ill patients that have an even difficult time accessing healthcare because of their minority status. The solution to this problem is to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues and integrate the healthcare system. This issue at hand is completely unethical because healthcare is a human right and should be afforded to all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><a id="id.w99wjn2opo5j"></a><span class="c1">Christian Keisel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Excessive Pronation of the Ankle Paired with an Axial Load</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The patient is a 21-year-old male soccer player, with no past medical history pertaining to his injury. The athlete caught his right foot on the ground while sliding, causing an axial load on his fibula when his foot was forced into pronation. There was no on field evaluation taken by the certified athletic trainer, all he assessed was the athlete&rsquo;s pain. At the hospital, it was noted that there was excessive swelling and ecchymosis around the right ankle, and there were no gross deformities. Fracture to the tibia, or any proximal tarsal bones. After the x-ray on 9/21/16 it was determined that the fibula was too displaced, requiring surgery. He then was placed in a splint for about two weeks after the surgery. After the two weeks, he was placed into a full cast for another month. After one month, his cast was removed on 11/2/16. It was determined that he was only permitted to be 25% weight bearing. The athlete worked on regaining range of motion in his ankle with various exercises. The patient used Game-ready daily post-rehab to diminish any lingering pain. He has also started strengthening and balance workouts with his rehab. This is an on-going case.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><a id="id.fa8co8l3t2yy"></a><span class="c1">Rachel Stroski</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Mandibular Fracture with Malocclusion of Teeth</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c17"><span class="c0">During basketball practice, a 18-year-old male basketball player was defending a player off of the ball when he was knocked off balance causing the athlete to collide with another player&rsquo;s shoulder.
