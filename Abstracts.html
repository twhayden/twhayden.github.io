Historically, Western European nations and China have had rather limited relations, with most interactions revolving solely around trade. To supplement other needs, Western European nations (eventually forming the European Union) have relied on other world powers such as the United States. However, with the United States fading from its preeminence and China rising in its place, the EU will have to develop a new relationship with China out of necessity.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.3wqr65v0xgxu"></a><span class="c5 c7">Steve Seifert</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Purpose of this study is was to see if in two weeks proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation PNF stretching would result in a greater increase in hamstring flexibility compared to Static stretching.

It helps connect people and countries together that may never have had any interactions if it weren&rsquo;t for this technological progress. These new interactions have led to an increase in new global policies including increased trading, especially free trade zones. Globalization has rapidly developed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries and has completely revolutionized the way countries interact with each other. Globalization has allowed access to new and cheaper goods and better relationships between countries, but it comes with its share of people doubting that the benefits of globalization outweigh the negatives that come with it. Donald Trump is someone that thinks the United States should focus more on the U.S. than on the world. He ran on a campaign of bringing back jobs and putting America first instead of focusing on a global approach. Each policy has its own benefits mixed in with negatives, and Trump&rsquo;s proposed policies could have large impacts on American businesses. With the election of Trump, more nationalist policies will be implemented, and only time will tell if they will help or harm American businesses.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.dqk038ya7lfu"></a><span class="c1">Madelaine Kuhn</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Dystonia is a muscular disease in which the muscles contract uncontrollably.

The three main reason kids decided to discontinue the sport was because the sport was not fun, burnout, and there was too much pressure. With this information, the answers of subjects, which are eighteen years of age or older, in my study may directly correlate with same subjects in the past experiment with their subjects under the age of eighteen.

This study was designed to see if mice housed in the same room with rats would be at a reproductive disadvantage over mice bred in a rat-free environment. Five pairs of mice were mated in the Longaker Animal Lab (LAL) in the presence of rats, and five pairs were mated in the Physiology Lab without rats present. Data for the number of pregnancies, number of offspring, and average daily weight gain of offspring were collected. The average weight gain per day for pups in the Longaker Animal Lab bred in the presence of rats was less than those in the Physiology Lab. However, success in pregnancy and survivorship of parents was significantly less in the Physiology Lab.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.ws1kkph81k1c"></a><span class="c1">Allison Farroni</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In 2009, Congress passed the Car Allowance Rebate System as part of an economic stimulus program.

In our project, we decided to use a case study approach to help students interpret the science behind modern food labels to make more informed decisions about their food purchases. The goal is to help students make informed decisions by asking questions, seeking answers, and finding and critically evaluating sources of information. We developed a variety of teaching methods, follow-up activities, and assessments to structure the lesson and evaluate student learning. We presented our work at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference in Denver last fall in order to share our ideas and gain feedback from science educators. Last semester, we implemented the case study into two sections of BIO110 lab. We are currently making revisions to the case study based off of observations made during the trial run.

This injury initially perplexed the attending certified athletic trainer, as the athlete has a curious congenital condition related to his patella. Medical imaging revealed multiple tears and other pathologies within the athlete&rsquo;s right knee. He underwent surgery to repair only one of the present ailments. Post-surgical rehabilitation and recovery started off slow, but the athlete has become more focused and is back on track. Non-contact knee injuries are unique in male subjects. Perhaps a previous history of bipartite patella has predisposed this athlete to this particular mechanism of injury.

From smartphones and fitness trackers to kitchen appliances and nuclear reactors, there are approximately 700 million devices connected to the Internet at any given time (Wright, 2017). However, many of these devices are not properly secured. Starting with an attack on October 21, 2016 that shut down websites based on the East Coast, like the New York Times and Wired, there have been several Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks originating from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Our presentation will define and describe these terms. We will also discuss the code that caused the first major attack, Mirai, and the effects of the code becoming open source. In addition to the code behind the attacks, we will discuss what makes IoT devices susceptible to hacking and how these devices are then used to create a bot army. Furthermore, we will look at what IoT device developers can do to make IoT devices more secure. Finally, we will investigate how these DDoS attacks affect users of these devices, if at all.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.9rsaeouvktv"></a><span class="c1">Conner Pacella </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I have done research looking into the trend of companies holding large amounts of cash.

By looking at different studies done there are common trends in companies that hold large amount of cash. The size of the company and its availability to external financing plays a large role in the amount of cash a company will hold. I have also found highly innovative companies can use larger cash holdings as financing as well as leveraging their cash holdings against its competition. Further, companies in product markets may stockpile cash in order to protect themselves against rival companies predatory tactics. By looking into each of these reasons I have found evidence supporting these claims of the advantages of businesses stockpiling cash.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.lohp4eii7tv8"></a><span class="c1">Robert Atha </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I will be presenting on the history, political systems and institutions, economy, contentious issues, and European Union agenda of the Czech Republic.

It can allow you to say the right things in any person&rsquo;s situation and read their situation and respond to it. This intelligence is used differently with individuals in different majors. Those that are health science majors and going into the healthcare field may need to have a different type of intelligence than those in the either the music or business majors. It could be interesting to compare the type and amount of emotional intelligence those in these majors have.

This research, however, found women to show less regret for non-vaginal hook ups. In the current study, participants completed a survey indicating self efficacy, sexual behavior, and their level of sexual regret. Self-efficacy is analyzed using the General Self-efficacy Scale created by Shwarzer and Jerusalem (1995). This study was designed to assess whether the number of hook ups (defined as a sexual encounter with an individual that one is not dating), is affected by the type of hook up: oral, anal, or vaginal. Furthermore, this study aims to assess whether lower self efficacy leads to lower contraception usage leading to an increase in sexual regret among college students. It is expected that the higher self efficacy will lead to more hookups, less use of contraception, and an increase in sexual regret.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.5pk5hw5eubxm"></a><span class="c1">Matthew Fee</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This research will examine why youth voting habits have no distinct patterns.

Still others argue that this culture of impunity and the escalation of violence simply worsens rates of gender-based crime in communities where it exists already as a part of everyday life. With women themselves becoming the battle ground, solutions must be implemented. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This presentation will center on gender-based violence in post-conflict areas and propose probable solutions.This specific focus is vital, as gender relations in a post-conflict area literally encompass the entire population, and can either make or break reconciliatory efforts.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.l2fo3q1d4t3z"></a><span class="c1">Gabrielle Osterman </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">European governments and citizens have been affected by the impact of the refugee crisis in the past years.

While this is intriguing, I&rsquo;ve wondered how it can help to improve a student&rsquo;s grades or intelligence while studying for exams as well as the result of the exam. This provides another question of does it affect students who cram until the last day for an exam or will those who study in advance and not take the medication prevail and perform at a higher rate of excellence. As it provides a multitude of benefits, there can be many risks to it as well. This includes multiple negative side effects that can lead to serious illnesses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For this study, I will conduct a survey which asks students questions about their gender, if they have ever taken performance enhancing medications such as Adderall or other varieties of it, how often do they take it, do they believe that it has enhanced or hindered performance, and so on. I believe it can help others in the sense that medication such as Adderall is not the only option when it comes to studying for extended periods of time for exams.

Interest was sparked by recent real-world developments: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sales of Barbie dolls were on a decline until the 2015 holiday season, which showed a turnaround in sales. Target stores recently announced they would convert to &ldquo;gender-neutral&rdquo; toy aisles in August of 2015. (TIME, 2015) Mattel also announced that it would alter the body images of its iconic Barbie doll to be more representative of natural women&rsquo;s bodies.

In order to gain knowledge about our memories we replay them over and over, weave them into the present, and develop a story that plays what we think or remember happened. The problem is, we take in stimuli regularly. With this stimuli we interpret the past and add to what we have in our memory. The problem occurs when stimuli taken in doesn&rsquo;t exactly match what we already have taken in or that present stimuli is perceived as true. At that moment, humans have a conscious decision to take in the new information and replace the missing pieces in their memory or disregard it altogether (Madill and Holch, 2004). Human memory isn&rsquo;t all that great. With the fact that assimilation in humans is huge, memories could be products of different experiences pieced together to resemble one moment (Mcfadden and Lusk, 2015). With this being said, human&rsquo;s memories could be manipulated to believe that something happened in their past that never actually happened. Also known as the suggestibility effect, researchers have found that human memory could be implanted with false information to create a memory that is completely unrealistic to the events a person encountered (Sondhi and Gupta, 2007). The current study relies on this basis to conduct an experiment where participants witness events and are asked about them directly after they occur. After a period of time (1 week) has passed the study will be given to the participants again, but they will not be replayed the event, they will be asked questions about their memory of the event. In this questionnaire, there will be false information and true information. The participant will be forced to choose between these two choices. If the memory of the event is not certain, the participant could choose the false information about the event and store it as fact. This will ultimately change the memory of the participant and the study would successfully implant false memories.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.sy7d66tkw9dk"></a><span class="c1">Morgan Miller</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this project I have combined the research from old kingdom Egypt and the literary tale Beauty and the Beast.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.jpgnkxawqfwg"></a><span class="c1">McKenna Essman </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Within this project, I combined the research of history and fairy tales to create a story.

Before observation the participant will read through the informed consent to ensure no confusion over the process and understand their rights and confidentiality throughout the research. A signature must be obtained. Participants will lay on the treatment tables in both supine and prone positions for measurement by goniometry. Immediately following the goniometric measurement the participant will be tested by Hawkins-Kennedy and Neers in standing position. These special tests diagnose possible shoulder impingement. All measurement and special tests will be performed under supervision of a certified athletic trainer.

The bank wanted the issue behind them. But instead, the settlement sparked a firestorm. Due to the drop in Wells Fargo, several customers are now faced with distrust and fallback in opening many checking accounting with any bank to this day. Banks are still concerned how to restore the confidence in customers and how they can better contribute to sustainable social and economic growth. Wells Fargo scandal case will then, lead into a discussion on corporate social responsibility (CSR), an attitude putting ethical norms in the spotlight. The CSR pyramid distinguishes various layers of responsibilities and how companies need to comply with legal norms. Ethical responsibility is the obligation to conduct in a fair way and to do the right thing.

It is important to study this relatively new research because as more players take precautions to avoid head injuries the less likely they will experience symptoms. I believe that the impact of head injuries at an early age is a new subject that not many people are aware of and if they were I believe that they would consider different interventions when it comes to the game of football at a young age. A recent study done by Dr. A McKinlay followed confirmed cases of mild head injuries before the age of 101. The group of patients were divided into three different groups. The groups were based on outpatient medical attention, inpatient observation, and the others were non-injured. The results of the study were that the inpatient groups showed an increase in hyperactivity rated by parents and teachers. The conclusion of the study was that most cases of mild head injuries in young children do not produce adverse effects but the long term problems in psychosocial function are possible. A research article published in Brain Injury2 studied the relationship between age of injury and long term neuropsychological impairment. Neuropsychological impairment is an internal and external clinical validation tool that tests cognitive deficits3. In the study, there were 29 children who sustained a traumatic brain injury and were then studied 6 years post injury. The researchers came up with a way to test intellectual knowledge, memory and frontal lobe functions by using paper and mechanical tools. The results were compared to 29 normal control subjects and from these results the researchers concluded that the younger the child was when they sustained a traumatic brain injury the worse the cognitive outcome was. The hypothesis of my research is that if more people are aware about the effects of head injuries at an early age, they will not choose to play football as a child. The research I am doing will add to the research that has already been established by providing the opinions of people from a small community, and establishing the basic knowledge concerning the effect of head injuries.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.ujkm7h7pwoee"></a><span class="c1">Sarah Baudo </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The experimentation was performed to better understand the characteristics people would choose to build their ideal mate.

Common ways cryotherapy is used are cold whirlpools (ice baths), ice bags, and ice cup. Athletes are willing to do anything to help their bodies to recover faster and be able to perform to the best of their ability. Cryotherapy has become a popular treatment to help decrease muscle soreness. However, evidence on cryotherapy has been controversial on if it really prevents and speeds up recovery or if it just satisfies the mind. The object of this study was to see if cryotherapy just helps physiologically or if it is influence by a psychological belief. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Research data was obtained from the athlete&rsquo;s ratings on muscle soreness when using cryotherapy and when they do not use cryotherapy treatment after a workout. The muscle soreness was rated on a Likert scale, one to six, on a sheet of paper. Athlete&rsquo;s perception on cryotherapy was obtain through a survey that took place at the very end of the experiment. The results were analyzed to find if cryotherapy treatment has an impact on muscle soreness or if it has a placebo effect. The hypothesized outcome was that cryotherapy will help prevent muscle soreness with the influence of the athlete&rsquo;s perception on cryotherapy. These findings will help athletes, coaches, and healthcare providers know if cryotherapy is an appropriate treatment for muscle soreness which will help the athletes perform at their best. The hypothesis was rejected and cryotherapy did not completely prevent muscle soreness, but did cause lower muscle soreness ratings. This was not true for all athletes who did believe in cryotherapy and used it. Athletes who never used cryotherapy and do not believe in it did have lower muscle soreness ratings the first week and higher ones the second week. The athlete&rsquo;s perceptions did not have a huge impact on the ratings.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.bia2grme5po0"></a><span class="c1">Jack Onderisin</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">China and the United States are two of the world&rsquo;s largest economies in terms of GDP.

There are two main types of sex education--abstinence only which does not allow for discussion of contraceptive use, and comprehensive education which does allow for such discussion. When comparing youth in abstinence based programs and those not in any program, results showed that both groups had a similar mean age for starting sexual activity, and had the same likelihood of unprotected sex, reported pregnancy rate, and average number of sexual partners (Trenholm et al., 2008). Based off of these findings, the hypothesis for this current study was that respondents who received either an abstinence only education or no sex education would have similar age of first sex, lower rates of contraceptive use, and lower confidence in their knowledge about preventing STDs when compared to students who received a comprehensive form of sexual education. The hypothesis was supported with the exception that students who received comprehensive sex education did not have higher rates of contraceptive use. This study added to previous knowledge by examining how sex education affected confidence in preventing STDs.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.7wbs1ksbmylm"></a><span class="c1">Alyssa Gable </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The purpose of this study was to see if social media use and likes effect the self-confidence of a person. My hypothesis is the more a person uses the social media outlet, the more important receiving likes is to them thusly making their self-confidence dependent on their social media use. Posting more often may make a person more susceptible to a stronger dependency on the liking system, which in turn effects their mood and self-confidence. This idea can create a cyclical effect because if a person&rsquo;s self-confidence is dependent on their use on social media, they will continue to keep using social media. Social media is based on a system that people have to validate and judge each other&rsquo;s posts, and this can lead to negative experiences (Kim &amp; Ahmad, 2012). Another study found that emotional stability was a negative factor that social media users share, and this was varied by the gender of the user (Brooks, 2015). Yang &amp; Srinivasan (2016) conducted a study that found that greater use of Facebook specifically led to lower affect of a person and life satisfaction.

Motor symptoms include mobility impairments, slowed speech and posture changes. Non-motor symptoms include depression, excessive drooling and sleeping disorders. There are many different treatments for this disease, including pharmaceutical, surgery, therapy, and a combination of those three. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The paper talks about the statistics, prognosis and treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease. Many Americans do not know the early symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s Disease, and therefore when the symptoms begin, people will be able to be diagnosed sooner and get treatment right away to help delay the onset of symptoms. Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease does not cause the death of an individual, people with it die usually from another disease or accident such as pneumonia or a fall. The purpose of this paper is to inform the public about Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease and the symptoms of the disease to help a person&rsquo;s family recognize the signs for Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease early on.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.a0mvgbi855lu"></a><span class="c1">Ashley Helmick</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The island of Puerto Rico was obtained by the United States from Spain in 1898 after the Spanish-American war. Since then, there have been debates surrounding Puerto Rico over its political status, its relation to the United States and its solidarity. Because of the confusion surrounding Puerto Rico, the island is now $72.6 billion in debt and the United States is not claiming any responsibility. The only thing that will save Puerto Rico now is if the United States gives Puerto Rico the title State or Nation, instead of pretending to call it a Common-Wealth.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.frbdpf81yee"></a><span class="c1">Andrew Dinger </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This paper explains what Real Estate Investment Trusts, (REIT), are as well and how they originally became available to the common person.

It was not until people began questioning whether or not animals had similar rights to humans, and inquiring if those rights were being violated through the minimal care routines that zoos began improving their facilities. In order to decrease stress, improve human-animal interactions, and increase socialization, research and various experiments were needed to determine what was to be done. Currently, zoos are putting a majority of their efforts into naturalistic enclosures that allow captive animals to behave and interact as they would in the wild, as well as ensuring that there is trust between zookeepers and animals to reduce stress and improve the lives of permanent residents. Those that are not permanent residents are treated with little human interaction for conservation purposes, making it a better transition to release them into the wild once they are able to care for themselves, increasing conservation efforts in and out of zoo facilities. With all of the efforts and new procedures being implemented in zoo and animal facilities, captive animals are receiving more ethical care than ever before.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.ybrytup03mxn"></a><span class="c1">Ryan Brewer</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This study will test to see if the amount of time spent playing video games has any affect on brain activity. Previous studies have been done on this and posted through numerous journals, as well as a TED Talk by Daphne Bavelier. My hypothesis is that a moderate amount of time spent playing video games will prove beneficial to a student. This will be tested by dispersing a survey through Student Announcements. Individuals GPA&rsquo;s, year in school, sex, and time spent playing video games will be required and all of these statistics will be tied together to determine if playing video games has a positive or negative effect on the brain. Social activities will be inquired about to determine how well the individuals communicate to others and react to others. The hypothesis is that individuals who play a moderate amount of video games, as well as studying, will have a higher GPA due to the benefits of moderate video game play. They also should have higher social skills due to the amount of social activities in today&rsquo;s video games. The communication factor should lead to higher social skills. There are minimal risks for this study and participation is voluntary. Participants must be above the age of 18 and are free to drop out of the study at any point in time. Extra credit will be offered to all students that participate in the study. If students do not wish to participate, an alternative extra credit opportunity will be offered.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.o7a3lzlqo3l5"></a><span class="c1">Kyle Karaffa </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c12 c13">For all of you college sports fans, no I am not talking about the Southeastern Conference. I am referring to the United States government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC&#39;s concept for investors in the market, whether they are a large institution or an individual, is to have the same basic information available to them to use when they are deciding whether to invest and while they are invested in those securities. The SEC works to ensure that companies are providing relevant and reliable information to the public. They work closely with Congress, government agencies, private organizations, and investors to determine what changes to regulations or additions need to be made for the betterment of the securities market. They are responsible for the oversight of the accounting and auditing field that must comply with the appropriate accounting standards and federal securities laws that are in place. Since the SEC does have significant influence in the securities market, it is interesting to look at the impact that a speech or announcement has on reporting firms and the market that was made by them. I will present my findings on the extent to which the Securities and Exchange Commission can influence the way reporting firms are expected to carry out their jobs with these simplistic methods.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c13 c16 c12 c10"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c13 c12 c10 c16"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.i24hd7179ct0"></a><span class="c1">Cory Jacobs </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Small businesses establish an important foundation for the United States economy by operating and developing the majority of firms within the country.

Being involved in intercollegiate sports, a noticeable number of student athletes become injured, not being able to compete. This observation sparks the question, &ldquo;What causes these injuries?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is weight change in college a factor?&rdquo; The question can be asked about the general campus population as well, not just student-athletes. A brief survey was sent out through student announcements and data was collected through the online survey. Two main comparisons were focused on: weight gain versus injury, and athletic involvement versus injury. The research showed that weight gain did not affect the likelihood of injury and athletics did affect the likelihood of injury. 66.7% of students who gained 15lbs or more also experienced an injury, but 63.5% of students who did not gain a substantial amount of weight (15lbs or less) still experienced an injury. 72.3% of students who competed in athletics reported an injury as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.e5vj37lq9cq4"></a><span class="c1">Courtney Arbogast </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This study aims to measure the relationship between social group membership, well-being, and social connectedness. Identifying with social groups has been shown to have a positive effect on well-being (Greenway, Cruwys, Haslam, &amp; Jetten, 2016). Well-being is also affected by social connectedness. Social disconnection has a negative effect on well-being, and as social connections increase, so does well-being (Haslam, Cruwys, Haslam, Dingle, &amp; Chang, 2016). It is hypothesized that higher social involvement will have a positive association with well-being and social connectedness. Results from a sample of 151 students from a private liberal arts university in the Rust Belt has shown identification as a student athlete is associated with significantly higher social connectedness, compared to students who identify as part of Greek life, or students who identify and neither Greek nor athlete. Involvement in both Greek life and athletics is not associated with a significant increase in social connectedness beyond the association with athletics. When adding self-esteem as a predictor, the average increase in social connectedness for athlete&rsquo;s decreases. In other words, group identity matters in the formation of social connectedness, but the effect of identity is separate from the influence of self-esteem.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.3n5098eolir3"></a><span class="c1">Shawn Beltz</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Physician assistants play an integral role in the health care system and will encompass a larger role in the near future. The study conducted was aimed to measure the level of confidence of patients receiving care from physician assistants (PA) and if students interested in the medical field had an increased confidence level. Even though it is a common mid-level provider in the health care world, many individuals still do not fully understand the scope of practice. A short survey was sent out to the Heidelberg University campus community and were encouraged to participate. Qualitative results showed several trends without statistical significance between individuals that have received care from a PA and confidence level. A trend of increased confidence in individuals that were interested in the medical field for a career and that had received care from a PA before completing the survey was also observed. The survey could have been more effective with increased participation and a larger scope of participants. Information on this topic is vital as mid-level providers are on the rise and will be relied more heavily as time moves forward. Mid-level providers are often mistaken for mere assistants and are able to perform varying levels of medicine when utilized correctly and are allowed to practice to the extent of their training.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.8p1x2jcvw1rp"></a><span class="c1">Michaela Honigman </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At times, people may not understand the opposite sex because males and females are cognitively different (Hannon, 2014). Psychologists have been interested in the idea of gender differences in cognitive abilities because of the stereotypes towards women and men (Hannon, 2014). Based on one&rsquo;s sex a person&rsquo;s brain is stronger in some areas than in others. This research it is not intended to stereotype people by gender but to understand the reason why males or females think and handle things the way they do. The chemicals in the brain plays a major part in the difference in cognitive abilities (Wilder, 1996). It is widely known that men are better in spatial recognition, while women are stronger in the verbal area (Wilder, 1996). The differences between how genders recall information from their memory has significant difference because the females may view something differently compared to a male (Wallentin, 2009). In order to understand the cognitive differences between males and females individuals must acknowledge the differences in brain structure, emotional intelligences, spatial and verbal ability, and memory between males and females.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.lxmgftlf42a"></a><span class="c1">Alex Archambaue</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c7 c11">This research covers the various rules, regulations, and provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

This study has participants fill out a survey that consists of questions from two categories, knowledge of cardiovascular disease and the amount of preventative measures conducted. The questions are then scored based on the guidelines and scoring conducted on the given survey. The only part of the survey that will be used is the patient portion. The scores on the two different sections of questions will then be compared to see if there is any relationship on knowledge, and the score they received on the risk factor score sheet.

Proper utilization of aromatherapy has been shown to increase interest in the task-at-hand, resulting in a more engaging learning experience (Kutlu, 2008). Participants exposed to lavender showed better focus and improved mathematical scores on stress-provoking tasks, even though it increased drowsiness (Burnett et al., 2004). Soothing scents tend to help aid students in relaxing in a classroom setting, in return, allowing them to stay focused when being presented with material. Scents that increased arousal and emotion were shown to decrease stress levels and increase concentration levels (Kutlu et al., 2008). For example, when lavender and rosemary are inhaled they have similar personal, cognitive outcomes on participants. Effects of these scents include completing a task more quickly, as well as greater sensitivity to visual stimulation, while impacting cognitive performance and decreasing anxiety (Moss et al., 2003).</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.nw9da4ja23ox"></a><span class="c1">Denise Bowes (2)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This paper analyzed the history of eugenics and how it brought the world to where it is today with reproduction and genetics. Scientists invented eugenics, improving the human population controlled by superior breeding to increase the number of desirable characteristics, with the use human genetics. Researchers strongly believed that the management and manipulation of genes could potentially improve the physical, mental, and behavioral qualities of the human race effectively over time (Kevles, 1985). The focus of this movement was to impact reproductive practice through applications of sterilization, contraception, segregation, and even abortion (Bashford &amp; Levine, 2010). During this movement, the value of a person was determined by their health and level of intelligence, which indicated that the interest of the community took precedence over the value of any individual (Kopp, 1936). The eugenics movement led the United States to where they stand today with the practice of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) (Baker, 2005 &amp; Damiano, 2011). This paper examines the evolution of eugenics to the health field today.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.8op5hjfniuin"></a><span class="c1">Dominic Frey</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This project is designed to study the housing market.

The few available taxonomic keys for identification of sphaeriids are outdated, ambiguous, and inoperative when identifying immature individuals that often comprise collections. DNA sequencing may help overcome these limitations. The purpose of this study was to investigate gene sequencing as a reliable method of identification for determining the distribution and abundance of native and exotic sphaeriid clams in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Individual clams were morphologically identified and sequenced for the 16S, 18S, and 28S rRNA genes. We considered the identifications to be: 1) a &ldquo;match&rdquo; if the sample was identified as the same species by both methods, 2) a &ldquo;partial match&rdquo; if there were multiple possibilities for either method, and there was overlap between the two, or 3) a &ldquo;non-match&rdquo; if the results were discordant. Of the 129 samples identified, there were 36 matches, 77 partial matches, and 16 non-matches. Further refinement of gene sequencing technology is needed to provide unambiguous identifications of the sphaeriid species known in the Great Lakes and those suspected of colonization.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.8q1526q5o76u"></a><span class="c1">Emily Howe</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The use of placebos in clinical studies has been an issue of ethics for decades.

The threat of terrorism in the EU has steadily grown since 9/11, and the issue has become one of the most contentious issues facing the Union. There are numerous strategies to combat this issue. However, increased integration is the most effective strategy in countering terrorism in the EU. Ashes to Ashes explores the EU&#39;s strategy following 9/11, how this has evolved since then, and the EU strategy following the attacks in Paris in 2015. The goal being to show the absolute necessity for increased integration despite reservations due to the loss of national sovereignty.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.dyj6gpeztcv"></a><span class="c1">Patricia Hartleip</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My presentation will discuss my experiences with interning for the Lake Erie Crushers and what I have learned that is related to my major.

Strips cut from phone books were hung in the eight cages as an enrichment material, and were weighed daily for two weeks to provide an indication of rat activity. Four cages housed four week old male rats, and five cages housed twelve week old male rats. Animals kept in captivity should be provided with enrichment materials in order to increase their activity. These animals enable students in the sciences to expand their learning, so in order to keep the rats in good health, it is important to take care of the rats physically and mentally, preferably at a low cost to the institution. The question asked with this study was if this style of enrichment could be used in future care of the rats or was there a difference between old versus young rats in their activity with the piece. Overall, there was a decrease in weight of the pages indicating there was activity of the rats with the pages.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.on317vsbkmrm"></a><span class="c1">Sarah Miller </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;If we are going to save environmentalism and the environment, we must also save an endangered indicator species: the child in nature&quot; (Richard Louv, &quot;Last Child in the Woods&quot;). In today&#39;s society there is a disconnect between man and nature. Children are kept inside by overprotective parents, increased time spent in school and other scheduled activities, and a shortage of nature in their neighborhoods. The decrease in time spent with nature has been linked to childhood obesity, depression, and behavioral problems. In order to reconnect children with nature, the societal perspectives need to change. Nature needs to become central in schools, households, and city planning, but small changes can be made when individuals choose to pass on love and respect for nature to the next generation. This presentation will present research findings that convey the need for children to become reconnected with nature, and persuade listeners that it is important to instill the values of nature education on the next generation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.yi71trz1g8xc"></a><span class="c1">Vickey Young </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This presentation explores the relationship between alcohol and functioning, both on a physical and sexual level.

I draw upon previous research to define practitioner inquiry, describe relevant components such as collaborative and tool-based inquiry, and identify what was found to have been learned by PSTs using inquiry. Using field observations and interviews, I studied six preservice teachers engaging in a Capstone inquiry project for opportunities and barriers to learn. My findings demonstrated: what the PSTs thought were opportunities to learn which include collaboration and scaffolds; barriers to learn that include opposing social science and science epistemologies, &lsquo;burnout&rsquo;, and writing; what they were able to demonstrate their knowledge in through those opportunities in terms of the teaching and learning relationship; and what the complex, cyclic, and transformative relationship was between inquiry, teaching and learning frameworks, and opportunities and barriers to learn. I then discussed how my findings support, address needs, and expand upon previous research. Lastly, I advocate messages of change to teacher education programs and teacher educators for frameworks of inquiry.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.95dio0fr1ef1"></a><span class="c1">Keri Newell </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nature based preschools are educational establishments set in the out of doors. This setting allows for students to authentically immerse themselves in the world outside. Nature based preschools were first established in Denmark in the 1950&rsquo;s and known as Forest Kindergartens. The concept has spread over Europe and they are now becoming popular in North America. These out of doors preschools are giving children an opportunity to participate in active learning by exploring their natural surroundings in a more inquisitive and hands on method. Research suggests that children are spending far less time out of doors than previous generations, leading to concerns about the overall health of and environmental understanding of this generation. &ldquo;Children are intrinsically motivated to move when given extended playtime in settings that are abundant with plant and animal life.&rdquo; (Jacobi-Vessels 2013) Allowing for unstructured play in nature based preschools can motivate students to socialize and participate in actions that end in &ldquo;ing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.7wkup0kyj9ym"></a><span class="c1">Christy Anzur, Taylor Windau </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our project is researching the growth of Under Armour since their conception in 1996.

When protein powders are produced, they may undergo chemical changes to their composition which may alter their components. Proteins or amino acids that may have been initially introduced to the powder may no longer be present in the final product. An assay of various protein powders can help determine the concentration of proteins in these products, and it can then be concluded whether the products&rsquo; labels accurately reflect their content or not. In addition to concentration, the assay can also help to determine the composition of the proteins themselves which further denotes the veracity of the product labels. A cost-analysis of the protein powders is carried out to compare the labeling accuracy versus final content of the various products. As a result of these analyses, the debate concerning if these products should be regulated by national standards is examined, and the effects this would have on the laws, ethics, and business surrounding the subject is also explored.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.bxgn6hg9nm9z"></a><span class="c1">Colin Higgins </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Faced with infertility, psychological scarring, being socially ostracized by family and community, and much more, the women who have suffered from gender-based violence during and after conflict deserve protection and support from the international community. A pervasive issue, the true extent of which has not even been fully documented, gender-based violence continues to plague the African continent. Given the nature of many conflicts and the prevalence of weaponry, many internally displaced persons, especially females, become vulnerable targets for gender-based crime. Still others argue that this culture of impunity and the escalation of violence simply worsens rates of gender-based crime in communities where it exists already as a part of everyday life. With women themselves becoming the battle ground, solutions must be implemented. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This presentation will center on gender-based violence in post-conflict areas and propose probable solutions.This specific focus is vital, as gender relations in a post-conflict area literally encompass the entire population, and can either make or break reconciliatory efforts.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.c0shhuy7bxzv"></a><span class="c1">Catherine Carey </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Based on her self-designed class one American describes her experiences with traditional medicine in Oaxaca, Mexico and her findings from interviews with traditional Mexican healers.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.fokpw92mw4s9"></a><span class="c1">Alyssa Gable</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">People have a desire to have close personal relationships, and in today&rsquo;s society, due to technology, dating can come in many different forms. While some still stick to traditional face-to-face interaction, others try to find partners through online websites and apps. The problem now lies if one way of dating is better than the other, or if online dating is the same and can replace traditional dating. Online dating is so common that one out of every five relationships is started from online dating (Hamilton, 2016). One of the main problems that occur from online dating is people lying on their profiles, because of the anonymity felt from using the internet (Rosen, Cheever, Cummings, &amp; Felt, 2008). However online dating is not restricted to close geographical proximity unlike traditional dating. Although both types of dating have positives and negatives research supports that relationships that start from both types of dating have about the same satisfaction in their relationships (Hall, 2014). Currently, there is no research that supports that there are more benefits to online dating in comparison to traditional dating.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.whk3p80y8r6"></a><span class="c1">Karlie DiRuzza </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As the shortage of physicians in primary healthcare escalates in today&#39;s society, the need for non-physician primary care providers is increasing. These non-physician providers include physician assistants and nurse practitioners- health professionals that are qualified to deliver much of the same care as general physicians. Many people are unaware of this shift in patient care and are uneducated on the services that each profession is capable of providing. The object of this study was to determine how well students understand the roles of these providers. The results of my research indicated that today&#39;s young adults have a weaker understanding of physician assistants and nurse practitioners as compared to general physicians. These findings implicate the need for increased education regarding non-physician practitioners so their roles within the health care system can continue to grow, and the shortage of primary health care providers can be reduced.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.8o5r0t6jsxyy"></a><span class="c1">Gregory Raimondo </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In a 2003 study conducted by Stuempfle and Drury, three methods were compared in the testing of urine specific gravity in college wrestlers.

I am interested to see how many of the tested dipsticks are considered to have a strong positive correlation (r = 0.8-1.0) when compared to the refractometer. I believe that there will be no more than two dipsticks that are considered accurate. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This research will provide information as to which urine dipsticks are considered the most accurate.

There has been a shift from physical questioning methods to mental questioning methods throughout the history of the criminal justice process in the United States of America. There are many ethical issues seen in the act of interrogation due to the secretive aspect that has always been associated with it. In the effort to fix ethical errors seen by detectives, there has been a push for recording through body cameras on officers while on duty and videotaping in the interrogation room. Even though videotaping may get rid of some unethical behavior, the line of what is ethical and what is unethical is hard to define. The average citizen would not be able to understand the differences between legal and illegal methods of interrogation if the videos were released for courtroom purposes. These issues are discussed in more depth while proposing different methods of what should be done to make the interrogation room a place for ethically sound methods.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.2lqd30akp198"></a><span class="c1">Anna Freidin </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Many times in life we are all faced with having to make difficult decisions.

The U.S. contains 4.4% of the world&rsquo;s population, but also houses 22% of the world&rsquo;s prisoners (Ye Hee Lee, 2015). It is due to things like violations of probation, drug and alcohol offenses, and sexual predators that we continue to lock up people and for extensive time periods. The sex offender registry contributes widely to this, and although similar to other felonies in the sense that it is carried with them for life, sex offenders are severely affected by this registry (Furst &amp; Evans, 2014).

The majority of democratically elected governments were overthrown and replaced with dictatorships. In Argentina&rsquo;s case the military came to power. It declared a &ldquo;Dirty War,&rdquo; which involved the systematic disappearance and torture of an estimated 14,000-30,000 citizens, labeled as &ldquo;subversives.&rdquo; These individuals were mainly young adults and children who were in disagreement with the military&rsquo;s values or method of rule in any way. While the Argentine politicians hid this injustice well at first, the international community discovered the violations of basic human rights rather quickly. The United Nations, Amnesty International, and other key humans rights groups became involved but encountered obstacles in their attempts to end the violence. The Catholic Church and Vatican ignored the tragedy for the most part, further marginalizing the victims. By the time the dictatorship ended, nearly an entire generation had been erased from Argentina&rsquo;s history, but their families continue the fight for justice to this day.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.zfi95cxywign"></a><span class="c7 c9 c10 c14">Alyssa Johnson</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Abstract not submitted in time for website.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.4728vvn08bwf"></a><span class="c7 c9 c14 c10">Jimmy Kenosh</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Abstract not submitted in time for website.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.mw0cttlbg1n0"></a><span class="c1">Kyle Slovick</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Abstract not submitted in time for website.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><a id="id.4zgeywgwv0uw"></a><span class="c1">Joshua Beacorn </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Abstract not submitted in time for website.</span></p></body></html>
